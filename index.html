			    <h1>Thanksgiving</h1>

			    <!-- Title -->
		     	<p>
		     	Each year on the fourth Thursday in November, Americans
		     	gather for a day of feasting, football and family. While 
		     	today’s Thanksgiving celebrations would likely be unrecognizable
		     	to attendees of the original 1621 harvest meal, it continues to 
		     	be a day for Americans to come together around the table—albeit 
		     	with some updates to pilgrim’s menu.
		     	</p>

		     	<p>
				In 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn
				harvest feast that is acknowledged today as one of the first Thanksgiving
				celebrations in the colonies. For more than two centuries, days of thanksgiving
				were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn’t until 1863, in the
				midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national
				Thanksgiving Day to be held each November.
		     	</p>

		     	<h1>THANKSGIVING AT PLYMOUTHM</h1>

		     	<p>
				In September 1620, a small ship called the Mayflower left Plymouth, England,
				carrying 102 passengers—an assortment of religious separatists seeking a new
				home where they could freely practice their faith and other individuals lured
				by the promise of prosperity and land ownership in the New World. After a treacherous
				and uncomfortable crossing that lasted 66 days, they dropped anchor near the tip of
				Cape Cod, far north of their intended destination at the mouth of the Hudson River.
				One month later, the Mayflower crossed Massachusetts Bay, where the Pilgrims, as they
				are now commonly known, began the work of establishing a village at Plymouth.
		     	</p>

		     	<p>
				Throughout that first brutal winter, most of the colonists remained on board the ship,
				where they suffered from exposure, scurvy and outbreaks of contagious disease. Only half
				of the Mayflower’s original passengers and crew lived to see their first New England spring.
				In March, the remaining settlers moved ashore, where they received an astonishing visit from
				an Abenaki Indian who greeted them in English. Several days later, he returned with another
				Native American, Squanto, a member of the Pawtuxet tribe who had been kidnapped by an English
				sea captain and sold into slavery before escaping to London and returning to his homeland on
				an exploratory expedition. Squanto taught the Pilgrims, weakened by malnutrition and illness,
				how to cultivate corn, extract sap from maple trees, catch fish in the rivers and avoid poisonous
				plants. He also helped the settlers forge an alliance with the Wampanoag, a local tribe, which 
				would endure for more than 50 years and tragically remains one of the sole examples of harmony 
				between European colonists and Native Americans.
		     	</p>

		     	<p>
				In November 1621, after the Pilgrims’ first corn harvest proved successful, Governor William Bradford
				organized a celebratory feast and invited a group of the fledgling colony’s Native American allies,
				including the Wampanoag chief Massasoit. Now remembered as American’s “first Thanksgiving”—although
				the Pilgrims themselves may not have used the term at the time—the festival lasted for three days.
				While no record exists of the historic banquet’s exact menu, the Pilgrim chronicler Edward Winslow 
				wrote in his journal that Governor Bradford sent four men on a “fowling” mission in preparation for
				the event, and that the Wampanoag guests arrived bearing five deer. Historians have suggested that
				many of the dishes were likely prepared using traditional Native American spices and cooking methods.
				Because the Pilgrims had no oven and the Mayflower’s sugar supply had dwindled by the fall of 1621,
				the meal did not feature pies, cakes or other desserts, which have become a hallmark of contemporary celebrations.
		     	</p>

		     	<h1>THANKSGIVING BECOMES AN OFFICIAL HOLIDAY</h1>

		     	<p>
				Pilgrims held their second Thanksgiving celebration in 1623 to mark the end of a long drought that had 
				threatened the year’s harvest and prompted Governor Bradford to call for a religious fast. Days of fasting
				and thanksgiving on an annual or occasional basis became common practice in other New England settlements
				as well. During the American Revolution, the Continental Congress designated one or more days of thanksgiving
				a year, and in 1789 George Washington issued the first Thanksgiving proclamation by the national government
				of the United States; in it, he called upon Americans to express their gratitude for the happy conclusion to
				the country’s war of independence and the successful ratification of the U.S. Constitution. His successors
				John Adams and James Madison also designated days of thanks during their presidencies.
		     	</p>

		     	<p>
		 		In 1817, New York became the first of several states to officially adopt an annual Thanksgiving holiday;
		 		each celebrated it on a different day, however, and the American South remained largely unfamiliar with the
		 		tradition. In 1827, the noted magazine editor and prolific writer Sarah Josepha Hale—author, among countless
		 		other things, of the nursery rhyme “Mary Had a Little Lamb”—launched a campaign to establish Thanksgiving as
		 		a national holiday. For 36 years, she published numerous editorials and sent scores of letters to governors,
		 		senators, presidents and other politicians. Abraham Lincoln finally heeded her request in 1863, at the height
		 		of the Civil War, in a proclamation entreating all Americans to ask God to “commend to his tender care all
		 		those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife” and to “heal
		 		the wounds of the nation.” He scheduled Thanksgiving for the final Thursday in November, and it was celebrated
		 		on that day every year until 1939, when Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the holiday up a week in an attempt to spur
		 		retail sales during the Great Depression. Roosevelt’s plan, known derisively as Franksgiving, was met with passionate
		 		opposition, and in 1941 the president reluctantly signed a bill making Thanksgiving the fourth Thursday in November.
		     	</p>

				<h1>THANKSGIVING TRADITIONS</h1>

				<p>
				In many American households, the Thanksgiving celebration has lost much of its original religious significance;
				instead, it now centers on cooking and sharing a bountiful meal with family and friends. Turkey, a Thanksgiving
				staple so ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have been on offer when
				the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast in 1621. Today, however, nearly 90 percent of Americans eat the bird—whether
				roasted, baked or deep-fried—on Thanksgiving, according to the National Turkey Federation. Other traditional foods
				include stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. Volunteering is a common Thanksgiving Day activity,
				and communities often hold food drives and host free dinners for the less fortunate.
				</p>

				<p>
				Parades have also become an integral part of the holiday in cities and towns across the United States. Presented 
				by Macy’s department store since 1924, New York City’s Thanksgiving Day parade is the largest and most famous,
				attracting some 2 to 3 million spectators along its 2.5-mile route and drawing an enormous television audience.
				It typically features marching bands, performers, elaborate floats conveying various celebrities and giant balloons
				shaped like cartoon characters.
				</p>

				<p>
				Beginning in the mid-20th century and perhaps even earlier, the president of the United States has “pardoned” one
				or two Thanksgiving turkeys each year, sparing the birds from slaughter and sending them to a farm for retirement.
				A number of U.S. governors also perform the annual turkey pardoning ritual.
	     		</p>

	     		<h1>THANKSGIVING CONTROVERSIES</h1>

				<p>
				For some scholars, the jury is still out on whether the feast at Plymouth really constituted the first Thanksgiving
				in the United States. Indeed, historians have recorded other ceremonies of thanks among European settlers in North
				America that predate the Pilgrims’ celebration. In 1565, for instance, the Spanish explorer Pedro Menéndez de Avilé
				invited members of the local Timucua tribe to a dinner in St. Augustine, Florida, after holding a mass to thank God
				for his crew’s safe arrival. On December 4, 1619, when 38 British settlers reached a site known as Berkeley Hundred
				on the banks of Virginia’s James River, they read a proclamation designating the date as “a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God.”
				</p>

				<p>
				Some Native Americans and others take issue with how the Thanksgiving story is presented to the American public, and
				especially to schoolchildren. In their view, the traditional narrative paints a deceptively sunny portrait of relations
				between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people, masking the long and bloody history of conflict between Native Americans
				and European settlers that resulted in the deaths of millions. Since 1970, protesters have gathered on the day designated
				as Thanksgiving at the top of Cole’s Hill, which overlooks Plymouth Rock, to commemorate a “National Day of Mourning.”
				Similar events are held in other parts of the country.
				</p>

				<h1>THANKSGIVING’S ANCIENT ORIGINS</h1>

				<p>
				Although the American concept of Thanksgiving developed in the colonies of New England, its roots can be traced back to
				the other side of the Atlantic. Both the Separatists who came over on the Mayflower and the Puritans who arrived soon after
				brought with them a tradition of providential holidays—days of fasting during difficult or pivotal moments and days of feasting
				and celebration to thank God in times of plenty.
				</p>

				<p>
				As an annual celebration of the harvest and its bounty, moreover, Thanksgiving falls under a category of festivals that spans cultures,
				continents and millennia. In ancient times, the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans feasted and paid tribute to their gods after the fall harvest.
				Thanksgiving also bears a resemblance to the ancient Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot. Finally, historians have noted that Native Americans
				had a rich tradition of commemorating the fall harvest with feasting and merrymaking long before Europeans set foot on their shores.

			    <h1>Christmas</h1>

			    <p>
				Many people think Christmas is on December the 25th and that's all there is to Christmas.
				However, for many people around the world, in different countries and in different Christian
				traditions, Christmas lasts for a lot longer than that - and it's even celebrated at different times!
			    </p>

			    <p>
				When Christmas is Celebrated
				Calendar showing 25th December
				Although December 25th is the date when most people celebrate Christmas, there are some other dates as well!

				Some churches (mainly Orthodox churches) use a different calendars for their religious celebrations. Orthodox Churches in Russia, Serbia, Jerusalem, Ukraine, Ethiopia and other countries use the old 'Julian' calendar and people in those churches celebrate Christmas on January 7th.

				Most people in the Greek Orthodox Church celebrate Christmas on December 25th. But some still use the Julian calendar and so celebrate Christmas on 7th January! Some Greek Catholics also celebrate on January 7th.

				In Armenia, the Apostolic Church celebrates Christmas on January 6th. It also celebrates 'Epiphany' on this day.
			    </p>

			    <p>
				Advent - The Time Before Christmas
				A Christmas Tree Advent Calendar
				Before Christmas, many Christians use the time of Advent to prepare themselves and get ready to celebrate the joy of Christmas, when Christians celebrate of the birth of Jesus, who they believe is the Son of God.

				Advent is normally a period of four Sundays and weeks before Christmas. In many Orthodox and Eastern Catholics Churches Advent lasts for 40 days, starting on November 15th.

				In Orthodox Churches which celebrate Christmas on 7th January, Advent start on 28th November!

				During Advent many people fast (don't eat certain foods). The types of food people give up depends on their church tradition and where in the world they live.
			    </p>

			    <p>
				After Christmas - The 12 Days of Christmas and Epiphany
				Drawing of a Partridge in a Pear Tree
				After Advent, traditionally, Christmas celebrations (and often a feast!) started on Christmas Day and lasted for 12 Days - so they were known as The 12 Days of Christmas! The celebrations finished on the evening of 5th January, which is better known as Twelfth Night.

				Throughout history, the 12 Days of Christmas were a time of feasting and fun.

				Following Twelfth Night, on 6th January, is Epiphany, when people remember the Wise Men (also sometimes called the Three Kings) who visited Jesus and/or the Baptism of Jesus.

				Epiphany/Twelfth Night is also the time when it was traditional to take your Christmas decorations down - although some people leave them up until Candlemas.
			    </p>

			    <p>
				Candlemas - The End of Christmas

				You might think that Christmas ends when you take the Christmas Decorations down - but it doesn't! After both Christmas and the season of Epiphany, the end of the Christmas celebrations come on February 2nd, 40 days after Christmas, with Candlemas.

				Candlemas, also known as the 'Presentation of Jesus at the Temple' or the 'Feast of the Purification of the Virgin (or Mary)' is the when some Christians remember the time when Mary and Joseph took the baby Jesus to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem to give thanks to God for giving them a son.

				It's a very important day in some Orthodox and Catholic churches.

				The name Candlemas comes from 'Candle Mass' because in many Candlemas services, the candles are blessed to be used in churches during the coming year or are given out to people for them to use in their homes and private prayers.

				In many Catholic churches, it's a time when people remember and renew promises they've made to the church and celebrate some of the prophesies which were given about Jesus.

				In many Eastern/Orthodox churches, an all night vigil is held on the night before the candle blessing ceremony. In the morning, the candles are blessed and are given out to people.

			    <h1>New Years</h1>

			    <p>
				Civilizations around the world have been celebrating the start of each new year for at least four millennia.
				Today, most New Year’s festivities begin on December 31 (New Year’s Eve), the last day of the Gregorian calendar,
				and continue into the early hours of January 1 (New Year’s Day). Common traditions include attending parties,
				eating special New Year’s foods, making resolutions for the new year and watching fireworks displays.
			    </p>

			    <h1>EARLY NEW YEAR’S CELEBRATIONS</h1>

			    <p>
				The earliest recorded festivities in honor of a new year’s arrival date back some 4,000 years to ancient Babylon.
				For the Babylonians, the first new moon following the vernal equinox—the day in late March with an equal amount of
				sunlight and darkness—heralded the start of a new year. They marked the occasion with a massive religious festival
				called Akitu (derived from the Sumerian word for barley, which was cut in the spring) that involved a different ritual
				on each of its 11 days. In addition to the new year, Atiku celebrated the mythical victory of the Babylonian sky god
				Marduk over the evil sea goddess Tiamat and served an important political purpose: It was during this time that a new
				king was crowned or that the current ruler’s divine mandate was symbolically renewed.
			    </p>

			    <p>
				Throughout antiquity, civilizations around the world developed increasingly sophisticated calendars, typically pinning
				the first day of the year to an agricultural or astronomical event. In Egypt, for instance, the year began with the annual
				flooding of the Nile, which coincided with the rising of the star Sirius. The first day of the Chinese new year, meanwhile,
				occurred with the second new moon after the winter solstice.
				</p>

				<h1>JANUARY 1 BECOMES NEW YEAR’S DAY</h1>

				<p>
				The early Roman calendar consisted of 10 months and 304 days, with each new year beginning at the vernal equinox; according to tradition,
				it was created by Romulus, the founder of Rome, in the eighth century B.C. A later king, Numa Pompilius, is credited with adding the months
				of Januarius and Februarius. Over the centuries, the calendar fell out of sync with the sun, and in 46 B.C. the emperor Julius Caesar decided
				to solve the problem by consulting with the most prominent astronomers and mathematicians of his time. He introduced the Julian calendar, which
				closely resembles the more modern Gregorian calendar that most countries around the world use today.
				</p>

				<p>
				As part of his reform, Caesar instituted January 1 as the first day of the year, partly to honor the month’s namesake: Janus, the Roman god of
				beginnings, whose two faces allowed him to look back into the past and forward into the future. Romans celebrated by offering sacrifices to Janus,
				exchanging gifts with one another, decorating their homes with laurel branches and attending raucous parties. In medieval Europe, Christian leaders
				temporarily replaced January 1 as the first of the year with days carrying more religious significance, such as December 25 (the anniversary of Jesus’
				birth) and March 25 (the Feast of the Annunciation); Pope Gregory XIII reestablished January 1 as New Year’s Day in 1582.
				</p>

				<h1>NEW YEAR’S TRADITIONS</h1>

				<p>
				In many countries, New Year’s celebrations begin on the evening of December 31—New Year’s Eve—and continue into the early hours of January 1.
				Revelers often enjoy meals and snacks thought to bestow good luck for the coming year. In Spain and several other Spanish-speaking countries,
				people bolt down a dozen grapes-symbolizing their hopes for the months ahead-right before midnight. In many parts of the world, traditional
				New Year’s dishes feature legumes, which are thought to resemble coins and herald future financial success; examples include lentils in Italy
				and black-eyed peas in the southern United States. Because pigs represent progress and prosperity in some cultures, pork appears on the New Year’s
				Eve table in Cuba, Austria, Hungary, Portugal and other countries. Ring-shaped cakes and pastries, a sign that the year has come full circle, round
				out the feast in the Netherlands, Mexico, Greece and elsewhere. In Sweden and Norway, meanwhile, rice pudding with an almond hidden inside is served
				on New Year’s Eve; it is said that whoever finds the nut can expect 12 months of good fortune.
				</p>

				<p>
				Other customs that are common worldwide include watching fireworks and singing songs to welcome the new year, including the ever-popular “Auld Lang
				Syne” in many English-speaking countries. The practice of making resolutions for the new year is thought to have first caught on among the ancient
				Babylonians, who made promises in order to earn the favor of the gods and start the year off on the right foot. (They would reportedly vow to pay
				off debts and return borrowed farm equipment.)
				</p>

				<p>
				In the United States, the most iconic New Year’s tradition is the dropping of a giant ball in New York City’s Times Square at the stroke of midnight.
				Millions of people around the world watch the event, which has taken place almost every year since 1907. Over time, the ball itself has ballooned from
				a 700-pound iron-and-wood orb to a brightly patterned sphere 12 feet in diameter and weighing in at nearly 12,000 pounds. Various towns and cities across 
				America have developed their own versions of the Times Square ritual, organizing public drops of items ranging from pickles (Dillsburg, Pennsylvania) to
				possums (Tallapoosa, Georgia) at midnight on New Year’s Eve.
